javascripture.mobi
==================

Rebuilding javascripture.org with React.js and browserify

Getting Started
---------------

To make changes locally you will need to install the necessary node modules, and rebuild.

```
npm install
npm run watch-js

```

Building files
--------------

The browserify builds are split into two files:
`api.js` and `build.js`

`build.js` is regenerated by the build script, like this:

```
browserify -t [ babelify --presets [ es2015 react ] ] -x ./src/api.js src/bootstrap.js | uglifyjs > build/build.js
```
